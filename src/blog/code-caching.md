V8 uses [just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) (JIT) to execute Javascript code. This means that immediately prior to running a script, it has to be parsed and compiled - which can cause considerable overhead. As we [announced recently](https://blog.chromium.org/2015/03/new-javascript-techniques-for-rapid.html), code caching is a technique that lessens this overhead. When a script is compiled for the first time, cache data is produced and stored. The next time V8 needs to compile the same script, even in a different V8 instance, it can use the cache data to recreate the compilation result instead of compiling from scratch. As a result the script is executed much sooner.

Code caching has been available since V8 version 4.2 and not limited to Chrome alone. It is exposed through V8â€™s API, so that every V8 embedder can take advantage of it. The [test case](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/4.5.56/test/cctest/test-api.cc#21090) used to exercise this feature serves as an example of how to use this API.

When a script is compiled by V8, cache data can be produced to speed up later compilations by passing `v8::ScriptCompiler::kProduceCodeCache` as an option. If the compilation succeeds, the cache data is attached to the source object and can be retrieved via `v8::ScriptCompiler::Source::GetCachedData`. It can then be persisted for later, for example by writing it to disk.

During later compilations, the previously produced cache data can be attached to the source object and passed `v8::ScriptCompiler::kConsumeCodeCache` as an option. This time, code will be produced much faster, as V8 bypasses compiling the code and deserializes it from the provided cache data.

Producing cache data comes at a certain computational and memory cost. For this reason, Chrome only produces cache data if the same script is seen at least twice within a couple of days. This way Chrome is able to turn script files into executable code twice as fast on average, saving users valuable time on each subsequent page load.
